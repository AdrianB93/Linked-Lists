#About this project

This is an example of my understanding of a basic data structure (linked lists) shown in C++. 

This project demonstrates linked lists being used to simulate the coordination of coal transportation on trains to help a business estimate the needed length of track for their new coal unloading facility. The assignment sheet from the uni course has been included in this repository to provide some context.

#Notes

Before running, I recommend having your terminal window minimum 140 characters wide. 

Type the following into your terminal (one line at a time).

###Other notes:

I removed some overloading functions from assignment 1's Train class during development, I had no need to re-implement them in this assignment as they were not used, so I left them out
